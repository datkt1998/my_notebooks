# Docker Build For JupyterLab

**In this guide, learn how to:**
- Run a personal Jupyter Server with JupyterLab on local machine
- Customize the JupyterLab environment
- Share the Jupyter notebook and environment with other DS.

**Why use Docker and JupyterLab together?**
- Containerization ensures a consistent JupyterLab environment across all deployments, eliminating compatibility issues.
- Containerized JupyterLab simplifies sharing and collaboration by removing the need for manual environment setup.
- Containers offer scalability for JupyterLab, supporting workload distribution and efficient resource management with platforms like Kubernetes.

```bash
# change the directory where the Dockerfile is located
cd coding/learning/contents/4_topics_and_guides/4_docker/projects/

# create folder
mkdir 1_docker_for_jupyterlab
cd 1_docker_for_jupyterlab

# Create Dockerfile
touch Dockerfile

# open Dockerfile in VSCode
code Dockerfile
